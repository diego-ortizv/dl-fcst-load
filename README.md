# Load Forecasting

This repository implements an end-to-end pipeline for electrical load forecasting, covering data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, validation, and backtesting.

The workflow is notebook-driven and designed for reproducibility and extensibility.

## Workflow

The project is organized as a sequential pipeline.  
**Notebooks must be executed in order.**

### 1. Data Acquisition

**Notebook:** `notebooks/0_download_data.ipynb`

- Downloads raw load and related data from COES
- Uses the `downloader` package for scraping and data retrieval
- Stores raw data locally for downstream processing

---

### 2. Data Processing

**Notebook:** `notebooks/1_process_data.ipynb`

- Cleans and preprocesses raw time-series data
- Handles missing values and temporal alignment
- Outputs a model-ready dataset to an autogenerated data directory

---

### 3. Model Training, Validation, and Backtesting

**Notebook:** `notebooks/2_model_training.ipynb`

- Trains forecasting model
- Performs hyperparameter tuning
- Validates model
- Executes historical backtests to evaluate generalization performance


## Downloader Package

The `downloader` module follows a **src-layout** structure:
- Treated as a standalone Python package
- Automatically installed when running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Imports assume the package is installed (no relative-path hacks)

## Reproducibility

- Notebook execution order is mandatory

- Dependencies are pinned in requirements.txt

- Any stochastic components (models, sampling, optimization) should fix random seeds inside notebooks
